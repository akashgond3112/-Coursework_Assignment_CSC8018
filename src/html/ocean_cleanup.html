              inventor-entrepreneur of Croatian and Dutch origin who serves as

            It is estimated that there is a stock of 86 million tons of
            plastic marine debris in the worldwide ocean as of the end of
            2013, assuming that 1.4% of global plastics produced from 1950 to
            2013 has entered the ocean and has accumulated there. 8.8 million
            metric tons of plastic waste are dumped in the world's oceans each
            year. Asia was the leading source of mismanaged plastic waste,
            with China alone accounting for 2.4 million metric tons. In 2017
            the UN estimated that by 2050 there will be more plastic than fish
            in the oceans, if substantial measures are not taken.

            Plastic waste has reached all the world's oceans. However, it has
            been found that plastic debris concentrates in the oceanic gyres
            where it forms extensive garbage patches. Of those, the North
            Pacific garbage patch is the biggest, with an estimated area of
            1.6 million square kilometers. Plastic accumulating in these
            patches photodegrades into smaller and smaller particles and
            releases toxic and endocrine chemicals such as bisphenol A (BPA).

            Plastic pollution harms an estimated 100,000 sea turtles and
            marine mammals and 1,000,000 sea creatures each year. Larger
            plastics (called "macroplastics") such as plastic shopping bags
            can clog the digestive tracts of larger animals when consumed by
            them and can cause starvation through restricting the movement of
            food, or by filling the stomach and tricking the animal into
            thinking it is full. Microplastics on the other hand harm smaller
            marine life. For example, pelagic plastic pieces in the center of
            our oceanâ€™s gyres outnumber live marine plankton, and are passed
            up the food chain to reach all marine life as well as human
            consumers.

            In 2011, aged 16, Dutch Boyan Slat came across more plastic than
            fish while diving in Greece. He decided to devote a high school
            project for deeper investigation into ocean plastic pollution and
            why it was considered impossible to clean up.

            Slat discontinued his aerospace engineering studies at TU Delft to
            devote his time to developing his idea. He founded The Ocean
            Cleanup in 2013. The group's mission is to develop advanced
            technologies to rid the world's oceans of plastic. In June 2014,
            the Ocean Cleanup published a 528-page feasibility study about the
            project's potential.

            Salesforce chief executive Marc Benioff, philanthropist Peter
            Thiel, Julius Baer Foundation and Royal DSM. The Ocean Cleanup
            raised over $2 million with the help of a crowdfunding campaign in

              The filtering system uses passive floating structures localized
              in the ocean gyres. These structures act as a containment boom.
              The floater drifts with the wind, waves and ocean currents to
              capture marine debris. A permeable screen underneath the float
              catches subsurface debris. The system is unmanned and
              incorporates solar-powered monitoring and navigation systems,
              including GPS, cameras, lanterns and an automatic identification
              system (AIS) for vessel traffic services.

              System 001, deployed in September 2018, consisted of a 800
              meters long barrier with a 3 meters wide skirt that hangs
              beneath it. System 001 encountered difficulties retaining the
              plastic collected. After two month of operation, during which
              the system had collected 2,000 kilograms of plastic, mechanical
              stress caused an 18-meter section of the structure to detach.
              After several months of root cause analysis and redesign, the
              organization employed System 001/B which could successfully
              capture and collect plastic, and even microplastics.

              At the end of July 2021, the organization revisited the Great
              Pacific Garbage Patch to trial System 002 -- a revamped version
              of the previous systems with an increased span of 1,600 metres.
              The new technology claims to capture 1,000 kg of plastics per
              day. As of 25 July 2022, The Ocean Cleanup announced to have
              removed a total of 100,000 kg of plastic from the Great Pacific
              Garbage Patch.

              The organization is now developing System 003, which is planned
              to have a three times bigger plastic intake than the current
              design. Unlike the previous prototypes, this new system is meant

              Responding to criticism that filtering devices closer to shore
              are easier to maintain, and likely to recover more plastic per
              dollar spent, the organization introduced an additional
              technology in October 2019 -- the River Interpector.
              Solar-powered Interceptor vessels use floating arms to direct
              floating waste into the collection conveyor, which dumps trash
              into dumpsters on a detachable barge below. When full, the
              collection stops until the barge is removed, emptied and
              returned to the Interceptor.
